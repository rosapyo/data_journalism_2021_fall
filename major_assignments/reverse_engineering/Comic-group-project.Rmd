This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(refinr)
```
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}
Sys.setenv("VROOM_CONNECTION_SIZE" = 131072 * 2)
```
```{r}

library(readr)
read_csv("dc-wikia-data.csv")
dc_wikia_data <- read_csv("dc-wikia-data.csv")
View(dc_wikia_data)


```
When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
